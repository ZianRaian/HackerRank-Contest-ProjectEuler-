# Greatest Product in a 20x20 Grid

## Problem Statement
Given a **20 × 20** grid of integers, find the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction:
- Horizontally (left to right)
- Vertically (top to bottom)
- Diagonally (top-left to bottom-right)
- Diagonally (top-right to bottom-left)

## Input Format
- Input consists of **20 lines**, each containing **20 integers**.
- Each integer is between **0 and 100**.

## Constraints
- **0 ≤ Each integer in the grid ≤ 100**
- The grid size is **20 × 20**.

## Output Format
Print a single integer, the maximum product found in the grid.

## Example
### Sample Input
```
89 90 95 97 38 15 00 40 00 75 04 05 07 78 52 12 50 77 91 08  
49 49 99 40 17 81 18 57 60 87 17 40 98 43 69 48 04 56 62 00  
...
01 70 54 71 83 51 54 69 16 92 33 48 61 43 52 01 89 19 67 48  
```
### Sample Output
```
73812150
```

## Solution Approach
1. **Iterate through each cell** in the grid.
2. **Check all four possible directions**:
   - Rightward (horizontal)
   - Downward (vertical)
   - Diagonal down-right
   - Diagonal down-left
3. **Calculate the product** for each direction and keep track of the maximum found.
4. **Return the maximum product** after checking all positions.

This approach ensures all valid four-number sequences are checked efficiently.
