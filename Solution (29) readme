This Python solution solves the Project Euler problem 29: Distinct Powers, which asks for the number of distinct terms in the sequence a^b for 2 ≤ a ≤ N and 2 ≤ b ≤ N.

Problem Description:
We are tasked with calculating the number of distinct terms generated by the expression a^b where:

2 ≤ a ≤ N

2 ≤ b ≤ N

For a given input value of N, we compute all the terms a^b for every combination of a and b in the given range, remove any duplicates, and return the number of distinct terms.

Example:
For N = 5, the distinct terms in the sequence generated by a^b for 2 ≤ a ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 5 would be:

Copy
{4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 125, 128, 243}
The number of distinct terms in this case is 15.

Approach:
Input: The input is a single integer N where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100,000.

Iterating over pairs of a and b: We iterate over each pair of a and b in the range 2 ≤ a ≤ N and 2 ≤ b ≤ N, and calculate a^b.

Set for Distinct Terms: We use a Python set to automatically store only distinct values, as sets automatically handle duplicates.

Output: The output is the number of distinct terms in the sequence.
