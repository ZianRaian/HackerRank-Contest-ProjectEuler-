Smallest Multiple:

This Python program calculates the smallest positive number that is divisible by all the numbers from 1 to N for multiple test cases. The smallest such number is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers from 1 to N.
Problem Statement

Given multiple test cases, for each test case, find the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all numbers from 1 to N.
Input Format:

    The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
    For each test case, there is a single integer N which denotes the range of numbers (from 1 to N).

Output Format:

For each test case, print the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all numbers from 1 to N.
Constraints:

    1 <= T <= 10
    1 <= N <= 40

Approach

To solve this problem, we need to compute the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all integers from 1 to N for each test case. The LCM of two numbers can be computed using the formula:
LCM(a,b)=∣a×b∣GCD(a,b)
LCM(a,b)=GCD(a,b)∣a×b∣​

We calculate the LCM iteratively for all numbers from 1 to N.
Solution Explanation

    LCM Calculation: For two numbers a and b, we compute their LCM using the relationship between LCM and GCD (Greatest Common Divisor). Python's math.gcd() function is used to compute the GCD.
    Iterative LCM Computation: We start with an initial result of 1 and iteratively compute the LCM of the result with each number from 1 to N.
    Efficiency: Given the constraints (N <= 40), this approach will efficiently handle all inputs.
