Problem Statement

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers  such that:



Given an integer , check if there exists any Pythagorean triplet  such that:



Find the maximum possible value of  among all such Pythagorean triplets. If no such triplet exists, print -1.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer  (number of test cases).

The next  lines each contain an integer .

Constraints





Output Format

For each test case, print the maximum product  if a valid Pythagorean triplet exists, otherwise print -1.

Example

Sample Input

2
12
4

Sample Output

60
-1

Solution Approach

Iterate over possible values of a up to N/3 (since a < b < c and their sum is N).

Compute b using the formula:



Compute c as c = N - a - b.

Check if a^2 + b^2 = c^2.

If a valid triplet is found, update the maximum product.

This approach ensures efficiency given the constraints of the problem.

Implementation

The problem is solved using Python. The function max_pythagorean_triplet(n) finds the maximum product for a given N, and a loop processes multiple test cases.
