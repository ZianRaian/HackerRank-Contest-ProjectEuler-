This project is a solution to the "Greatest Product" problem on HackerRank. Given a large number as a string and an integer K, the program finds the maximum product of K consecutive digits within the number. The solution reads multiple test cases, processes each one, and outputs the result.

Problem Statement

For each test case:

Read an integer N (length of the number) and an integer K (number of consecutive digits to consider).

Read an N-digit number as a string.

Compute the maximum product of K consecutive digits.

Print the result.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of:

A line containing two integers N and K.

A line containing an N-digit number as a string.

Output Format

For each test case, output the greatest product of K consecutive digits.


Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(NK), where N  is the length of the number and K s the number of consecutive digits being considered. This is because, for each possible starting position of a K -digit window (O(N)), we compute the product by iterating through K digits (O(K)).
