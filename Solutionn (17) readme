This problem requires converting a number into its English word representation with the first character of each word capitalized.

Solution Approach 

We break the number into segments of Billions, Millions, Thousands, and Hundreds, and convert each segment to words using a predefined mapping.
Key Considerations

 Use recursion to process numbers efficiently.
 Predefine words for numbers 1-19 and multiples of 10 (20, 30, ..., 90).
 Handle edge cases like 0, and ensure proper spacing in output.

Breaks down number efficiently → Works in O(log N) time
Uses recursion for modularity → Reduces redundant computations
Handles edge cases like 0 properly
Uses sys.stdin.readline() and sys.stdout.write() → Optimized for large inputs

Time Complexity Analysis
Operation	Complexity
Processing Each Test Case	O(log N)
Overall for T Cases	O(T log N) (Efficient for large values)
