Problem Statement

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. If all permutations are listed in lexicographic order, we need to find the Nth lexicographic permutation of the string "abcdefghijklm".
Input Format

    The first line contains an integer T (number of test cases).

    Each of the next T lines contains an integer N.

Constraints

    1≤T≤1001≤T≤100

    1≤N≤13!1≤N≤13! (479001600)

Output Format

    Print the Nth lexicographic permutation of "abcdefghijklm" for each test case.

Sample Output

abcdefghijklm
abcdefghijkml

Approach

This problem is solved using the factorial number system:

    Precompute factorials for faster calculations.

    Determine each character of the permutation by using integer division and modulus.

    Efficiently remove used characters from the available pool.

Time Complexity

    Precomputing Factorials: O(13)O(13)

    Finding N-th Permutation: O(13)O(13)

    Total Complexity per query: O(1)O(1) 


Optimizations Used

Precomputed Factorials → Speeds up calculations
List Removal (del chars[idx]) → More efficient than .pop(idx)
Buffered Output (sys.stdout.write()) → Faster than multiple print() calls
